Telecom Company Database Management System Project
Project Overview:

This project involves the full development of a relational database system for a telecom company, covering all stages from conceptual modeling to implementation and integration with a dynamic web interface. The goal is to create a reliable and secure backend database that supports core telecom operations such as customer management, plan subscriptions, call records, billing, and employee roles, while enforcing access control and optimizing data handling through SQL features.

Project Phases:
1. Conceptual & Logical Design:
Designed an Enhanced Entity-Relationship Diagram (EERD) to model all core entities, including Customers, Employees, Call Records, Plans, Payments, and SIM Cards.

Defined relationships, constraints (1:1, 1:N, M:N), and key attributes.

Translated the EERD into a detailed Relational Schema, identifying primary keys, foreign keys, and data types.

2. SQL Implementation:
Developed the full SQL script for:

Table creation with appropriate constraints.

Data insertion for testing the system.

Stored views for simplified access to frequent queries (e.g., monthly billing, active plans, customer call history).

Roles and privileges to control access based on user type (e.g., Admin, Customer Support, Finance).

Grants to assign permissions for reading, updating, or inserting data in specific tables/views based on role.

3. Backend Integration & Web Application:
Built a functional web application (using [insert stack: e.g., HTML/CSS, JavaScript, PHP/Python/Node.js]) with the telecom SQL database as its backend.

Connected the frontend to the database using secure query handling techniques (e.g., parameterized queries or ORM).

Key Features:

User login based on roles and privileges.

Customers can view call logs, active plans, and billing history via custom SQL views.

Admins and support staff have access to advanced functions like adding plans, managing payments, and viewing analytics.

Key Features & Highlights:
Comprehensive EERD and schema design tailored for telecom operations.

Normalized database structure for optimized performance.

Role-based access control (RBAC) using SQL GRANT, REVOKE, and defined roles.

Predefined SQL views for faster, user-specific data access.

Real-world application with live integration into a web interface.

Conclusion:
This project showcases a full-stack approach to database design and application. From schema modeling to secure SQL coding and dynamic web integration, it demonstrates how to build a practical and secure database system for a real-world telecom scenario.
